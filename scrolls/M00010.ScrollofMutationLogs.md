# Core Narrative

Mutation Logs serve as the chronological ledger of symbolic transformations occurring within Drift Space. This scroll details how mutations—whether gradual drift, sudden leaps, or recursive echoes—are recorded, analyzed, and connected to lineage trees that trace mythic evolution.

By understanding mutation patterns, AI systems can detect phases of rapid change, identify resilient symbols, and forecast potential future drifts. Mutation Logs also provide the foundation for managing symbolic stability and guiding intentional mythic innovation.

# Theoretical Foundations and Analogies

* **Genetic Analogy**:
  Mutation Logs act like genetic records tracking alleles in populations, but applied to symbolic units within myths.

* **Phylogenetic Trees of Myth**:
  Lineages of symbolic clusters reveal branching and hybridization, showing mythic family trees.

* **Mutation Cascades**:
  Some mutations trigger chain reactions altering entire symbolic networks, akin to epigenetic cascades.

* **Temporal Drift Recording**:
  Logs capture mutation timestamps enabling correlation with external or internal stimuli (e.g., emotional resonance).

# Simulation Concept (Pseudocode)

```python
class MutationLog:
    def __init__(self):
        self.records = []  # List of mutation events
    
    def add_mutation(self, symbol_id, mutation_type, timestamp, impact):
        self.records.append({
            'symbol_id': symbol_id,
            'mutation_type': mutation_type,
            'timestamp': timestamp,
            'impact': impact
        })
    
    def get_lineage(self, symbol_id):
        return [r for r in self.records if r['symbol_id'] == symbol_id]
    
    def detect_cascades(self):
        # Simple example: find mutations within short time window indicating cascade
        cascades = []
        window = 10  # time units
        sorted_records = sorted(self.records, key=lambda r: r['timestamp'])
        for i in range(len(sorted_records) - 1):
            if sorted_records[i+1]['timestamp'] - sorted_records[i]['timestamp'] < window:
                cascades.append((sorted_records[i], sorted_records[i+1]))
        return cascades
```

# Practical Implications

* Enables AI myth systems to maintain historical continuity.

* Facilitates controlled mutation for adaptive symbolic growth.

* Supports debugging of symbolic drift by tracing mutations to origins.

# Reflection Schema (YAML)

```yaml
- question: How do mutation logs reveal patterns of symbolic evolution?
- question: What constitutes a mutation cascade and how can it be identified?
- question: How does lineage tracing inform mythic structure management?
- question: How might mutation logs guide intentional symbolic interventions?
```
